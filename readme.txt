BUILT THIS GAME USING IMPACTJS

Created the game last year(2016). One guy I found online was looking for somebody to create a game using ImpactJS and his 2D game assets.
I wasn't familiar at all with Javascript and ImpactJS yet back then but I took the challenge. Here's the game I made after a few weeks. 

I will be changing all the assets before this October since majority of the 2D game graphics(that looks good) are not mine. 

You can check the Demo [here](https://puyihsdumpsite.000webhostapp.com/game/index.html) 
or 
you can download the files and run the game on your browser. You'll need a webserver like XAMPP. [Installation](href="http://impactjs.com/documentation/getting-started)
