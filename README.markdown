#  A GAME I BUILT WITH IMPACTJS

Created the game last year(2016). One guy I found online was looking for somebody to create just a game prototype using ImpactJS and his 2D game assets.
I wasn't familiar at all with Javascript and ImpactJS yet back then (that's why some of my code are :poop:) but I took the challenge because I will be diving into learning Javascript anyway since I was learning Web Development at that time and I was hoping that I might get a job opportunity :disappointed:. 
Anyway, here's the game I made in 2-3 weeks. 

You can check the Demo on your desktop [here](https://puyihsdumpsite.000webhostapp.com/game/index.html) 
<br>or<br> you can download the files and run the game on your browser. You'll need a webserver like XAMPP. [help](http://impactjs.com/documentation/getting-started)

I will be changing some of the game assets before this October since majority of the 2D game graphics(that looks good) are not mine :sweat_smile:.
